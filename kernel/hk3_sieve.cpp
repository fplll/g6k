/**
    Multi-threaded Gauss - triple sieve.

    Naming conventions: Global variables and types from Siever that are specific to triple-sieve are
    prefixed TS_, the functions are prefixed with hk3_sieve (which is also the name of the main function).
    The hk3_sieve_ prefix is often dropped in the documentation.

    The multi-threaded triple gauss sieve works (on a very high level) as follows:
    Our database of vectors consists of 2 parts, a LIST and a QUEUE.
    The list part contains vectors where we know that (almost) no reductions are possible among them.
    (More precisely, if each of x1, x2, x3 is from the list part, then we will not find a reduction
    among this triple with our employed heuristics).
    The queue part is the rest of the database.
    Every possible reduction we can find must involve one vector from the queue.
    So the algorithm proceeds by taking an element from the queue part and processing it to check whether it
    can be used in a reduction. After processing, it ends up in the list.

    The processing itself will take an element p from the queue, create a filtered list of points x1
    that are close to +/-p. If p +/- x1 is already short, we call this an "outer" 2-reduction.
    Otherwise, we search for pairs within the filtered list that allow for "inner" 2-reductions (not involving p)
    or 3-reductions (involving p).

    NOTE:   "inner" 2-reductions are only considered if TS_perform_inner2red is set; the same inner 2-reduction
            may be found via many different p's if the algorithm has to consider many different p's.
            In particular, in a regime where the algorithm actually processes all p's, parameter settings
            that are optimized for 3-reductions will lead to many collisions for that reason. Furthermore,
            every inner 2-reduction will eventually be found as an outer 2-reduction anyway, if all p's are processed.
            By contrast, with standard parameters optimized for 2-reductions with a large database size, only a tiny
            fraction of p's are actually processed. Also, our collision detection is cheap, which is why
            TS_perform_inner2red is set to true by default.

    This way, the algorithm is both a 2-sieve and a 3-sieve, allowing a continous time-memory tradeoff.
    If the database size is large, 2-reductions will dominate the algorithm and the algorithm is fast(er),
    otherwise we need 3-reductions. A consequence is that the algorithm has to perform well in different settings,
    which might need tuning of parameters.

    We also support on-the-fly lifts of both pairs and triples.

    ----

    How the datastructures work:

    The database of points consists of a main db (which contains the full entries)
    and a series of cdb-snapshots, which contains compressed entries which index into db.
    The cdb-snapshots are partially sorted and regularly resorted.
    Every time, we resort, we create a brand new cdb-snapshot.
    The cdb-snapshots themselves are stored in TS_cdb_snapshots, which is a fixed-length array
    of std::vector<CompressedEntry>'s together with some reference counters. We use a hand-crafted
    preallocation and memory recycling scheme for those. All accesses (need to) go through dedicated functions
    to handle reference counting, concurrency and memory management correctly.

    After a thread finishes sorting, other threads will eventually learn about the new cdb-snapshot and use that one.
    Threads ideally use the most recent one, but might use outdated data, which causes (recoverable!) errors).

    An individual snapshot is a std::vector (whose size must not change during a triple sieve run).
    It is separated into 5 parts and has the following form
    (Having a handwritten copy of this picture is recommended for reading the actual code):

    +-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
    |            ~~LIST~~               |                       ~~QUEUE~~                         |
    | untouched list | overwritten list | processed queue | unprocessed queue | overwritten queue |
    |   SORTED       |  UNSORTED        |         JOINTLY SORTED              |    UNSORTED       |
    +-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------+
    ^                ^                  ^                 ^                   ^                   ^
    |                |                  |                 |                   |                   |
    |                |<-   list_left  ->|                 |<-  queue_left   ->|                   |
    |                |                  |                 |                   |                   |
    0         <=insert_list         start_queue        queue_head=>     <=insert_queue         db_size

    The individual 5 parts are all ranges with indices 0, TS_insert_list, TS_start_queue, TS_queue_head, TS_insert_queue, db_size.
    As usual, the left bound is inclusive, the right bound exclusive.
    TS_list_left (currently unused and may be commented out) and TS_queue_left store the size of the
    respective parts as indicated in the picture (up to some multi-threading issues, explained later).
    While these variables conceptually belong to a given cdb-snapshot (of which there may be more than one)
    and should be thought of as part of a cdb-snapshot struct, we actually only (need to) store these
    variables for the most recent snapshot as members of the sieve object.

    Some of the parts are sorted, some are not. The <= and => in the picture denotes how these bounds may
    move during the lifetime of a cdb snapshot.

    Immediately after sorting / at the start of the algorithm, we only have an untouched list and an
    unprocesessed queue. The other parts are empty. (At the very start, the untouched list is empty
    as well unless we carry over information from previous incantations, so we only have the queue part).
    Both parts are individually sorted and at this point, there are no findable reductions that involve only the list part.
    When processing the data, we take the shortest element p from the unprocessed queue part
    (and increment queue_head). We then try to find reductions. After that, p will be part of the processed queue.
    Conceptually, the processed queue belongs to and will eventually be merged with the list part,
    in the sense that all reductions only involving these parts have already been found.
    It's just that we delay inserting it into / merging with the list part, because that requires expensive resorting.
    The actual reductions that are found when processing p will give new (shorter) vectors that are first put on a per-thead transaction_db.
    Elements from such a transaction_db are then used to replace (preferably long) vectors.
    The replacement happen by replacing elements from the (original) list or queue part from the right, i.e.
    at TS_insert_list-1 or TS_insert_queue-1, decrementing TS_insert_list resp. TS_insert_queue.
    The replacement elements then form the overwritten list resp. the overwritten queue.
    (Note: This means that list_left can shrink due to such insertions. queue_left can shrink either by insertions or by choosing a new p)
    These overwritten elements might participate in further reductions, so they should be thought of as "queue" elements,
    and will eventually be merged with the queue. Again, we delay this, because it would require resorting.
    Note: Replacements are allowed to fail in various ways. It may happen that we move TS_insert_list or
    TS_insert_queue without doing an actual replacement. The precise behaviour is subject to change and may have changed
    and the algorithm should be flexible enough not to rely on too many guarantees from the insertion routine.
    (Note that Insertion failures are very expensive for the algorithm if it happens when inserting into the list part,
    because this leads to repeated processing of the very same p)

    If queue_left becomes smaller than TS_max_extra_queue_size or we have made TS_resort_after * db_size many
    (possibly failed) replacements, we trigger resorting. During resorting,
    the merger of the old untouched list and the old processed queue become the new list. The rest becomes the new queue.

    The algorithm terminates when one of the following conditions is true:
        - We have reached saturation
        - The queue is exhausted after resorting
        - We have reached a maximal number of resorts
    If one of these is true, we set the flag TS_finished to an appropriate exit code
    (which indicates the first reason to terminate that was encountered). Individual threads will then finish the next time
    that a new p is due to be processed (This means that processing a given point p is always finished once started).
    After we have finished the threaded parts in this way, we ensure that all pending transactions are merged with the database.
    In the rare case that we finished solely due to queue exhaustion and this final merge step has produced sufficiently many new queue
    elements, we may actually restart another run of the algorithm. (This situation happens, e.g. if the sorting thread gets
    preempted for longer than it takes the other threads to process the whole database, which can indeed happen).

    ---

    Multi-threading considerations

    It helps to have the following mental picture of the algorithm:
    [This model is kind-of accurate from a data-flow point of view, if not from a control-flow point of view]
    Think of db / the current cdb snapshot as a database server, with several clients connected to it.
    The clients contact the server to get a queue element p (together with a range of the database to compare against).
    This defines a work package for the client, who has to find triple reductions involving p
    (finding inner 2reduction, which might not involve p, are fine as well; we use whatever we find).
    The client then locally processes the work package and finds reductions. These reductions are then
    sent back to the server, who changes its database accordingly. Because communcation is costly, we buffer the
    communication with the server and only send our reductions in larger chunks.

    We have 4+1 main functionalites to consider:
    (0) hk3_sieve, which initializes data
    (1) hk3_sieve_get_p, which returns a point p and moves queue_head
    (2) hk3_sieve_task, which processes p, finds otf lifts and reductions, which are put onto transaction_db
    (3) hk3_sieve_resort, which creates a new sorted cdb-snapshot and updates the variables
    (4) hk3_sieve_execute_delayed_insertion, which puts transaction_db elements into the latest cdb-snapshot and db.

    (0) is single-threaded and requires no consideration.
    (2) actually operates completely locally. The compressed entries read might be from a previous snapshot
        and the db elements might be overwritten (and actually garbage due to interleaving writes).
        Our approach here is to simply check in the end if the new vectors are good. This is technically
        UB, but seems to work. It helps that any set of bytes is a valid Entry::x. In the end, we only
        care if the result is short (which we can check thread-locally). The actual insertion will
        eventually perform a (thread-safe) check whether we are indeed improving.
    (3) has to create a new snapshot from the old one. For this purpose, it needs essentially exclusive
        access to all variables that determine the splitting into 5 parts. Consequently, this conflicts
        with (1)get_p and (4)insertions. We also only want one thread sorting, even if multiple theads detect
        that sorting is due.
    (1) needs to increment queue_head without running into insert_queue and conflicting with sorting.
        We also want to allow concurrent calls to get_p. (most of get_p operates under a lock, though)
    (4) insertions potentially conflict with (3) and (1) and with each other. We want to allow concurrent
        insertions, since they are into different parts of the snapshot anyway.

    We use the following mechanisms to tackle these issues (apart from the fact that some variables obviously need to be atomics)

    -   There is a global order of snapshot creation / sortings, so we can talk about "next snapshot" etc.

    -   We use an atomic variable TS_queue_left to synchronize the increments of TS_queue_head and decrements of
        TS_insert_queue.
        Any thread that wants to perform any such increment / decrement must atomically decrement
        TS_queue_left before by the corresponding amount. Only if the result after the atomic
        decrement is still >= 0 is the thread allowed to increment / decrement
        TS_queue_head / TS_insert_queue by at most the given amount. The thread is obliged to increment
        TS_queue_left by an appropriate amount if the value after the decrement was negative
        (or if the thread changed TS_queue_head / TS_insert_queue by less than TS_queue_left).

        Note that there is little happens-before-synchronization beyond atomicity between the modifications of TS_queue_left,
        TS_queue_head and TS_insert_queue and different threads may disagree on the order of modification of
        different variables on non-sequentially-consistent architectures.
        Furthermore, both the back-increments after failed decrements (i.e. those leaving a negative value)
        of TS_queue_left and the modifications of TS_queue_head / TS_insert_queue after successful increments
        of TS_queue_left may be interleaved by other operations.

        The guarantee that we need is that the total set of modifications to TS_queue_head / TS_insert_queue
        is such that every pair of values in the modification order of TS_queue_head and TS_insert_queue that "belongs
        to a given snapshot" satisfies TS_queue_head <= TS_insert_queue.
        This is what the above rules (and the fact that TS_queue_head / TS_insert_queue / TS_queue_left are atomics)
        aim to achieve. Note that this relies on atomicity/mutex-protection of the invidual TS_queue_head / TS_insert_queue,
        which guarantees that there even exists a modification order of these (individual) variables.
        (TS_queue_head and TS_insert_queue are sufficiently protected by mutexes, which is why they do not need to be atomic)

        The synchronization, that is indeed neccessary, is in fact rather indirect:
        In order for "belongs to a given snapshot" to be meaningful, we need to synchronize
        the increments / decrements to TS_queue_head, TS_insert_queue, TS_queue_left with sorting,
        more precisely with the reset of those variable during sorting:
        all increments / decrements must happen-before any such resets for the next snapshots
        and any resets for a given snapshot must happen-before any increments / decrements for this snapshot.
            (Formally, this means that there is a happens-before relationship between any pair
            [increment/decrement to TS_queue_head | TS_insert_queue | TS_queue_left] and
            [reset of TS_queue_head | TS_insert_queue | TS_queue_left]. The latest
            reset of [TS_queue_head | TS_insert_queue | TS_queue_left] that happened-before any increment/decrement
            defines what snapshot an increment/decrement belongs to. Note that the resets occur in triples
            that are associated to a snapshot and the former definition must not depend on which of the three
            reset events we use.
            The increment/decrement to TS_queue_left and the associated back-increment or modification to the
            other variables must belong to the same snapshot.)

        For the increments / decrements during get_p, this is ensured by locking the mutex TS_queue_head_mutex in get_p.
        This mutex is also locked during the reset during resorting.

        For the increments / decrements during during execute_delayed_insertion, this is done via
        TS_insertions_started / TS_cdb_insertions_finished, explained below.

        This solves concurrency issues of (1) with itself and (4).

    -   We use a mutex TS_queue_head_mutex to protect all accessess to TS_queue_head.
        (Writes to TS_queue_left are also only allowed if this mutex is held or the implicit CDB-Mutex is held, see the (1) - (4) issue above)

        This solves concurrency issues (1) - (3)

    -   We use a mutex TS_insertion_selection_mutex to protect TS_insert_queue and TS_insert_list
        (reads / writes are also allowed if the implicit CDB-mutex is exclusively held)
        This allows that the selection where we insert actually appears to be atomic.
        (Note: What this mutex really is about is to protect cdb_snapshot[potential_insertion_position].len during the
               the part of (4) that determines where and how much to insert. For this part of (4), we
               can not guarantee that the ranges are disjoint.)

    -   We use an atomic_flag TS_currently_sorting to make sure only one thread can sort.
        Any thread that want to sort must successfully raise this flag (with it being non-set before)
        before actually calling hk3_sieve_resort. Conversely, any thread that raises this flag
        must actually call hk3_sieve_resort and clear the flag after sorting is finished.
        Threads that want to raise the flag, but fail because it is already set should NOT
        wait until is is cleared, but either assist in sorting or do some other useful work.
        Some logic is in place to encourage that every but the last cdb-snapshot only triggers only one sort
        (i.e. we do not want a cdb-snapshot C to trigger a sort, then after the sorting is done,
        another threads resorts because of some condition that is tied to the by-now outdated snapshot C.
        As this is not fatal, it's enough to make this very unlikely to happen.)

        This settles (non-)concurrency of (3) with itself.

    -   We use TS_insertions_started and TS_cdb_insertions_finished as an (implicit) mutex-like protection for
        the cdb bounds TS_insert_list and TS_insert_queue as well as for actual writes to cdb.
        This essentially consists of an atomic (bool + counter), where the counter is realized as the higher-order bits
        of an single atomic variable.
        A theads that wishes to non-exclusively acquire this locks needs to atomically increment the high-order bits of
        TS_insertions_started, provided the low-order bits of TS_insertions_started are cleared.
        To release, increment TS_cdb_insertions_finished by 1.
        A thread that wishes to exclusively acquire this lock needs to set the low-order bits of TS_insertions_started to 1
        (provided it was 0 before) and then wait until TS_insertions_started / 2^number_of_low_order_bits == TS_insertions_finished.
        (Note that TS_insertions_started / 2^number_of_low_order_bits can not change any longer after setting the low-oder bits)
        To release the exclusive access, clear the lsb again.

        We use this to prevent concurrency issues with (3) and (4):
        We can have multiple insertions threads, which need access to TS_insert_list / TS_insert_queue and write to cdb.
        sorting requires exclusive access to those.

    -   We use TS_insertions_started and TS_db_insertions_finished as an (implicit) mutex-like protection.
        It works similarly to the mechanism before. (Note that we use the same _started variable)
        While it relates db insertions and sorting, this is really about preventing concurrent db writes to the same
        db element (hence the name). Within one given cdb-snapshot, db insertions are guaranteed to be to
        disjoint db locations, since every cdb-location is overwritten at most once.
        (This synchronization is rather indirect and implicit...)
        We have to assure that all db writes for a given cdb-snapshot are finished before we start any
        new writes.

    hk3_sieve_task is the main worker function of the triple-sieve.
    hk3_sieve will thread-dispatch several workers running this function.

    Roughly speaking (ignoring some multi-threading issues),
    it operates by obtaining elements p from the queue (which describes a "job" for the worker).
    We then process p by first comparing p with every element from the current cdb snapshot (or a subrange)
    to produce a sub-list of the current cdb snapsnot as a local bucket. We then search for reductions within that bucket.

    Newly found reductions are buffered with a transaction_db and regularly merged with the current cdb snapshots.

    For reasons of efficiency, as opposed to a naive for(x1:bucket) { for(x2:bucket) { ... }} inner double-loop,
        (a) the bucket is processed while we create it (this gives potential reductions earlier)
            (i.e. a run of for(x2:bucket) is triggered whenever we add an element to the bucket, modulo (b);
            note that this avoids checking the same pair (x1,x2) twice as (x2,x1) )
        (b) This processing itself is buffered in cache-friently chunks to reduce memory-latency
            (i.e. we swap the order of loops: We collect N many x1's before we do a
            for(x2:bucket) { for(i<=N) {process those x1's with x2 }},
            where N is chose such that the all N x1's should fit into the cache)
    This innermost loop is delegated to a function template hk3_sieve_process_inner_batch(...) to avoid some code duplication.

    Getting p and merging the transactions are delegated to designated functions.

    Params:
    transaction_db is the transaction_db used. (This is created by the calling thread, so unmerged transactions are passed to the caller)
    id is the thread-id (ranging from 0 to #threads-1), used purely for debugging purposes
    alpha is a constant parameter taken from hk3_sieve.

/**
    The function mt_init_metainfo resets / set up the various TS_ members after sorting or the start of the algorithm.
    More precisely, it initializes the variables that define the decomposition into list / queue parts.
    Furthermore, it sets up
    - the lenght bound for new insertions
    - data to determine whether the next insertions are to go to the list or queue.
    - TS_insertions_performed (counting the number of insertions since the last resort, used to trigger sorting)
    (NOTE: The latter might go away completely).
    Note that TS_latest_cdb_snapshot_p is not touched. For getting the length bounds, it takes a fast_cdb pointer
    that should equal to the data() entry of the latest / upcoming CDB snapshot.
    (Regarding upcoming: for switching to a new cdb snapshot, this function is called to setup the decomposition into parts
    before changing TS_latest_cdb_snapshot_p to the new snapshot)

    Does NOT set TS_finished

    This function has NO thread-safety measures. Thread-safety is the responsibility of the caller, which means
    that enough locks must be held to prevent any concurrent access to the decomposition.
    (At the moment, this means TS_queue_head_mutex and the implicit TS_insertions_started must be held to block get_p and insertions (sortings are also blocked for several reasons))

    This function updates TS_len_bound and returns its value;

    TS_len_bound is the value used to determine whether a possible reduction is an insertion candidate.

    Note that this function has no internal thread-safety measures. This is the responsibility of the caller.
    (Currently, it is only called by init_metainfo, so there are no issues at the moment.)
    IMPORTANT: If we update TS_len_bound more often, we need to address this.

    The current formula takes a weighted sum between the length of a middle list and a middle queue element,
    where the middle list element is list element indexed by TS_improvement_db_ratio * list_size
    (and similarly TS_improvement_db_ratio * queue_size).
    This is intended to mimic what bgj1 does, in the sense that any improvement increases the rank of the cdb element by at
    least a certain factor. Be aware that this is quite heuristical and we do not have as nice guarantees as
    in the bgj1 case (where the resort threshold is tied to the improvement_db_ratio and we do not have
    the list / queue distinction): in particular, we are not even guaranteed that the length bound is monotously
    decreasing during the algorithm.

    NOTE:   We do NOT multiply the obtained length by a factor 1-epsilon. In particular, if all database elements
            have the same length, we might make only minimal progress.

    NOTE: It might be worthwhile to experiment with different bounding functions. Since both list and queue parts are sorted,
    finding the actual TS_improvement_db_ration * db_size's largest element is actually possible in
    O(log db_size) time. (cf. what is used in execute_delayed_insertion)

    /********************************************************************************************
                    How the insertion algorithm works on high-level & rationale:
    *********************************************************************************************

    We perform the actual overwriting of the current cdb-snapshot +db in several steps
    1.) We determine where and how many elements we insert in one go (alternatively, we prune, and skip 2--4)
    2.) We modify the corresponding TS_ indices to reserve a block inside cdb
    3.) We perform the actual replacements in cdb
    4.) We perform the actual replacements in db

    We may or may not perform 1+2 under a lock to make the modifications atomically
    (either lock or hope for the best && make some tests later, needs experiments)
    The current implementation uses a lock, because there are tricky data races with the cdb-accesses otherwise.

    We wish to basically overwrite appropriate worst vectors from the end of the queue / list, provided
    the vectors in transaction_db are actually shorter.
    A moment's though reveals that the problem we wish to solve here in step 1 is to find the (indices of the)
    t = #transaction_db many longest elements in the union of the 3 ranges overwriteable-queue, overwriteable-list and transaction_db.
    i.e. we want to select X elements from the queue part, Y elements from the list part and Z elements from the transaction_db such that
    these X+Y+Z = t elements are the t longest from their union.
    Then we overwrite Y list elements and X queue elements with the X+Y shortest transaction_db
    elements and prune the remaing Z transaction_db elements.
    Since the 3 ranges are individually sorted, it is enough to determine the numbers X,Y,Z of elements and this can be done in time O(log t).
    (This algorithm is well-known for 2 ranges and is essentially a binary search for the splitting of t into the ranges)
    For the case of 3 ranges, the algorithmic idea can be generalized and restated as follows:
    We know that at least one of the following three options is true for any x+y+z = t+2
    a) At least x of the t longest elements have to be from the queue part (-> We need to insert at least x elements into the queue)
    b) At least y of the t longest elements have to be from the list part (-> We need to insert at least y elements into the list)
    c) At leass z of the t longest elements have to be inside transaction_db (-> We have to prune transaction_db by at least z elements)
    (Proof by contradiction: otherwise, we simultaneously have X <= x-1, Y <= y-1, Z <= y-1, which implies (by adding) X + Y + Z <= t - 1)
    Determining one of the cases (a),(b),(c) that is true can be done by simply
    comparing the x'th largest element from the queue part, the y'th largest element from the list part
    and the z'th largest element from the transaction_db part.
    In each case, the problem can be recursively reduced to one with smaller value of t.

    Note that we do not care how the X+Y shortest elements of transaction_db are distributed to X elements from the queue
    and Y elements from the list in the end (they ultimately end up in the queue after the next resort).
    So rather than determining X, Y, Z completely by a recursive algorithm
    before doing any actual insertions / pruning, we include the actual insertion / pruning in the recursion:

    In cases a) or b), we can assume that the shortest x resp. y elements of transaction_db will end up in the queue resp.
    the list. In case c) we can prune the z longest elements from transaction_db.
    Consequently, we can avoid determining X,Y,Z completely, but rather just find some number
    x,y,z we can be sure to insert / prune.
    Then we actually perform the corresponding action as a "microtransaction" and then start over with a smaller value of t.
    (This makes a difference in multi-threading, since several threads are concurrently performing such actions.
    Also note that we can actually release the implicit locks in between the restarts with smaller t;
    this matters if some thread starts sorting in the meantime. )
    If x,y,z are at least a constant fraction of t, the total cost of Phase 1 + 2 from processing t inital elements is only O(log t).

    Since we do not really care that *exactly* the t longest elements are eliminated, we will put everything into either the
    queue or the list for small values of t (we still may wish to do pruning correctly for list insertions, though).
    "Small values" is generous and can be as large as the
    threshold where we actually trigger execute_delayed_inserion, so we expect the majority of
    insertions to actually use the small-t algorithm.

    **********
    Rationale:
    **********

    Be aware that the reason to use the large-t algorithm at all is to avoid phase 1+2 from potentially becoming a bottleneck:
    Since it is effectively a critical section, if 1+2 becomes a bottleneck due to high number of threads,
    depending on locking strategy used, various types of bad things would happen.
    E.g. if we return to caller after failing to grab the lock for 1+2 (as we do!),
    we would end up producing transactions faster than we can process them.
    We want to avoid such scenarios by design.
    The current design essentially implicitly auto-adjust the "microtransaction" size to the current contention level.
    Furthermore, the neccessity to determine X,Y,Z rather precisely arises from the fact that wrong list insertions in step 2 are
    very costly. Once we reserve a part of the list, we really want to make an actual replacement.
    If we later determine that the new element is actually longer than what we had, we can bail out,
    but this would still turn a list element into a queue element later. Consequently, the algorithm
    would then re-process the same element as p multiple times, which hurts overall performance.
    (In the (plausible!) scenario where the longest list elements are barely longer than the shortest queue
    elements, this phenomenon can be catastrophic: we have no guarantees of any progress at all.
    Avoiding both a bottleneck in 1+2 and list insertion failures basically rules out a naive algorithm.

// For this, there exists a (global) repository TS_cdb_snapshots of currently existing snapshots
// (this includes "inactive" snapshots, which can be re-used). Note that, since we cannot reallocate
// TS_cdb_snapshot itself due to atomics, it is a fixed-length array of size TS_max_snapshots, but only the first
// TS_snapshots_used entries are valid (in the sense that the std::vector TS_cdb_snapshot[i].snapshot
// has reserved some memory).

// The datastructures are initialized / de-initialized in the (non-threaded part of) hk3_sieve,
// stealing memory from cdb. Within the threaded part, *all* access to the latest snapshot must go through
// the following functions, with the following usage restrictions:

// A thread that want to get access to the latest cdb snapshot can use either
// hk3_sieve_get_true_fast_cdb(...) or hk3_sieve_get_latest_snapshot(...). These differ
// in usage characteristics and limitations.

// With auto local_ptr = hk3_sieve_get_latest_snapshot(...),
// the calling thread can get a local copy of some cdb snapshot that can be freely used until hk3_sieve_release_snapshot is called.
// Any such call must be paired off with a call to hk3_sieve_release_snapshot(local_ptr) by the same thread,
// which invalidates local_ptr again. local_ptr can then be reassigned with hk3_sieve_get_latest_snapshot(...).
// (This means that to change the thread's local version, we first release the old, then assign some new)

// hk3_sieve_get_true_fast_cdb gives a pointer to the latest cdb snapshot without the need to release and is more efficient.
// This function must only be called and the result used when the implicit TS_insertions_started / TS_cdb_insertions_finished lock is held.
// (Note that the latest cdb snapshot cannot change while this implicit lock is held)

// hk3_sieve_get_free_snapshot will return a new TS_cdb_snapshots of a new snapshot.
// Note that this function might create new snapshots and block if too many snapshots are in use.
// (So the calling thread might need to release its own local_ptr's first before calling to avoid deadlock)

// The result of mt_get_free_snapshot must be used in a subsequent call to hk3_sieve_update_latest_cdb_snapshot by the same thread.
// This atomically published the new free snapshot.
// This pair of calls needs to be done within a critical section and no other snapshot-related functions must be called in between by this thread.
// Between the pair of calls, the thread has exclusive access to the new snapshot.
